The main goal of this blog is to serve as a place to collect noteworthy things that I encounter during my work as a
software engineer. This may include topics ranging from software development, design, architecure and technologies
 to practices that are good to have in an engineering team.

Despite the fact that I'm planning to publish posts mainly for myself to organize and track my knowledge and
 experiences, I believe that some of them might be helpful for someone encountering challenges similar to those that
 I've been facing.
